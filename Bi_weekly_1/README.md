## Biweekly Report 09/08/21

### Report Goals:
The goal of this initial bi-weekly report is to better understand the concepts covered over the first weeks of Applied Deep learning. These concepts will include building convolutional nueral networks, specifically pertaining to the MNIST dataset to start. 

### Data Used:
For the our preliminary exercises, we will be using the MNIST data-set. This seems to be a great beginner data-set to become more comfortable with some of the topics we have covered in the first few weeks of class. 

### EDA_Character_Data.ipynb
In this module, we explore the MNIST data-set, which we will be using for some preliminary exploration of image classification techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks. 

Here is a paper of particular interest that we viewed in class: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.2745.pdf
