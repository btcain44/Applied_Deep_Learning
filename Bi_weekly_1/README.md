## Biweekly Report 09/08/21

### Report Goals:
The goal of this initial bi-weekly report is to better understand the concepts covered over the first weeks of Applied Deep learning. These concepts include building concolutional neural networks, multi-column deep neural networks, and more. 

### Data Used:
For these exercises the data used were the MNIST and the NIST SD 19 datasets for the multi-column deep nueral networks. On top of that I also wanted to try my hand in building a convolutional neural network on the CIFAR-10 dataset.  

### EDA_Character_Data.ipynb
In this module, we explore the dataset that will be used in our multi-column deep neural network. This data will be used in an attempt to replicate the results of  "Multi-column  deep  neural  networks  for  image  classification."  2012  IEEE  conference  on  computer  vision  and pattern recognition. Goals to be accomplished in this script are a basic data analysis of the images, specifically with the intent of giving us some intuition on the best alpha parameters to specify before we start training. 

### MCDNN_Creation.ipynb
In this module we will be creating a multi-column deep neural network for the MNIST and NIST SD 19 dataset in an attempt to calculate the characters in the images.
